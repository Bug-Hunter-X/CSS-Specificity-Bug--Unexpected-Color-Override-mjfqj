The following CSS rule creates an unexpected layout issue because of specificity:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```

The `div p` rule is more specific and overrides the `p` rule, resulting in the text inside a `<div>` having blue color instead of the expected red color.  This is an uncommon error because it's a subtle issue related to CSS specificity.
