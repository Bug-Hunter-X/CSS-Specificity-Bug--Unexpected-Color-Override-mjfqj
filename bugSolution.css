Several solutions exist to fix this issue:

**1. Adjust the order of CSS rules:** Place the more specific rule *after* the less specific rule in your CSS file. This leverages the CSS cascading behavior to apply the later rule.

**2. Increase specificity of the overridden rule:**  Make the `p` rule more specific by adding an extra selector such as:

```css
div > p {
  color: red !important; 
}
```

**3. Use the `!important` flag (use cautiously!):**   Use the `!important` flag to override the specificity. This is generally not recommended as it can lead to difficult-to-maintain CSS, but it can be used in specific situations:

```css
p {
  color: red !important;
}
```

The `bugSolution.css` demonstrates option 1.  Remember to choose the best solution based on your specific project and coding style.  Avoid using `!important` unless absolutely necessary.
