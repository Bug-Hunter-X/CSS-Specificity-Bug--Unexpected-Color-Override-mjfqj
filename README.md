# CSS Specificity Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle CSS specificity issue.  The `bug.css` file contains a CSS rule that overrides another due to higher specificity. This can lead to unexpected styling behavior.

The `bugSolution.css` shows a possible solution by restructuring the CSS or using the `!important` flag (though using !important is generally discouraged).
